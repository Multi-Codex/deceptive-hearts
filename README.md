Source code for the DDLC mod: Deceptive Hearts

Mostly releasing this so people can access the story script more easily.
I'm fine with any modifications/add-ons/sequels to Deceptive Hearts as long as you clearly state that I do not endorse it and that you state that the original mod was made by Codex and iiTzWolfyy.
